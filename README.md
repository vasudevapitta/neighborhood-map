# Neighborhood Map (Restaurants in Harrisburg PA)

![neighborhood map app](https://github.com/vasudevapitta/neighborhood-map/blob/master/screenshot.png)

This is my final project(7) for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program.
The goal of this project was to implement the Google maps API with React to display a list of locations in a certain area and use a third party api to display details about each location.

## Development Tools
React was implemented using the [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Google Maps was implement using [google-maps-react](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)

This project also uses [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)

## Deployment & Projection Build
For the project to build, the below files must exist with exact filenames
- index.html is the page template
- favicon.ico is the icon you see in the browser tab
- src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point
You may rename other files - but make sure the renaming occurs inside the corresponding files which link to each other.
You may create subdirectories inside the src directory. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src directory are processed by Webpack.
Any new JS or CSS files should be inside the src directory, or Webpack won't see them.

You can however create more top-level directories.
They will not be included in the production build; so you can use them for things like documentation.

To run this app follow these instructions:

Download or clone the repository and unzip the files 
- cd into the project folder
- Run npm install
- Run npm start
- Open http://localhost:3000
or enter Y for yes if you already have a project running on port 3000 and would like to run this project on a different port- then open http://localhost:YOURPORTNUMBER

### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React into production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### npm eject
If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices,
you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Credits
