This is my final project(7) for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program.
The goal of this project was to implement the Google maps API with React to display a list of locations in a certain area and use a third party api to display details about each location.

## Development Tools
React was implemented using the [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

Google Maps was implement using [google-maps-react](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)

This project also uses [FourSquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)

## Deployment
To run this app follow these instructions:

Download or clone the repository and unzip the files 
- cd into the project folder
- Run npm install
- Run npm start

## Credits

Special thanks to my classmates Carlos & Forrest who helped me out when I got stuck.

## License
This is a project developed by me - although the project idea & requirements are set by Udacity.
